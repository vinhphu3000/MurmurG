==========================
VERSION 0.91
UPDATE ON APR-25-2017
==========================
- Added a new scene, "Mining Agent Demo" that shows
how to set up a NPC that has a daily job of collecting wood. 
He automatically searches for nearby trees and chops them to collect wood.
2 sample scripts were added (MiningObject.cs and Woodcounter.cs) that relate
to this - these scripts help keep track of how much wood was collected, and
the effects to play on the tree being chopped.

- Added new scene, "Turret Stationary Gun Demo" - shows how to set up
a stationary gun or turret that rotates at a target. It's a FPS scene
that lets you move around the turret while it shoots at you.

- Fixed minor potential glitch for Unity 5.6 users where sometimes a bullet
triggering a custom function would hit the ground/wall and trigger error about
missing function.

- Fixed missing prefabs in Boss Battle scene.

- User Manual is not updated this time, but will be updated next time.
We have not heard from any users about confusing features or needing
help with something not in the tutorials / user manual.
