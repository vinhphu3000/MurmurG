WHAT IS "SILVER AI"?: What is "SILVER AI" and why do I see console messages from "Silver AI"?  AI Designer Pro was originally intended to be the 2nd version of "Silver AI", an AI system we created a while ago. We decided to publish it as a different name since it is drastically different from its predescessor.  There may be some "Silver AI" names in the code we decided not to switch out.

FUTURE UPDATES: I originally built this AI system for my development team for us to quickly iterate and share AI for multiple game projects.  It mostly served our needs. If you have specific feature requests, send it to me at aibotsystem@gmail.com or go to www.AIBotSystem.com.  If there's enough demand, I'll add it in!  Same for bugs and errors. This is beta with beta pricing)... Current buyers receive free updates, even when this product's price goes up.
